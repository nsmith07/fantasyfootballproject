# Fantasy Football Project

pip install - requirements.txt


## Read in Data
I read my data in using pd.read_csv() by importing the pandas module. I read in my csv containing the fantasy football data for my project.


## Manipulate and Clean Data
I cleaned my data by taking my dataframe and breaking it down into indivual dataframes based on the position a football player plays. For example, I have individual dataframes for Quarterback (qb), Runningback(rb), Wide Reciever(wr), Tight End(te). Then, I created the function transform_columns to add the specific columns I wanted to each dataframe.


## Analyze Data
I want to analyze to find trends of what positions to priortize when drafting a fantasy football team.

## Interpret Your Data and Graphical Output

I want to find a way to use Django or flask to create a website to visulize my data.
